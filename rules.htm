            Morabaraba is a traditional two-player strategy board game played in South Africa, Botswana and Lesotho. <br />
            Morabaraba is accessible and easy to learn, and games can be played quickly, but the strategic and tactical aspects of the game run deep. <br />
            The board is empty when the game begins. Each player has 12 pieces, known as 'cows'; one player has white cows and the other has black cows. <br />
            Each turn consists of placing a cow on an empty intersection on the board.<br />
            The aim is to create a row of three cows on any line drawn on the board<br />
            Then he or she may remove one of the opponent's cows. The cow is removed from the board and not placed again.<br />
            A cow in a set of three may not be removed unless all of the opponent's cows are in sets, in which case any cow may be removed.<br />
            Even if a move creates more than one set, only one cow can be removed in a single move.<br />
            After all the cows have been placed, each turn consists of moving a cow to an empty adjacent intersection.<br />
            When a player has only three cows remaining, desperate measures are called for. This player's cows are allowed to 'fly' to any empty intersection, not just adjacent ones.<br />
            You win if your opponent cannot move.<br />
            You win if your opponent has just two cows.<br />
            If either player has only three cows and neither player removes a cow within ten moves, the game is a draw.<br />
